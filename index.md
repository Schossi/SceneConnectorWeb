SceneConnector aims to improve your multi scene workflow by providing a central SceneConnector component that can be used to load and unload scenes in both the editor and runtime. Connected scenes can be loaded and unloaded directly inside the scene view. While you are creating your world a graph of all the connections is automatically created. Jump to any scene or connector in your graph at the click of a button.
